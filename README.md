## ICEbot for node.js

How to use:

Install Node.js on your terminal (cmd) and them run the npm code:
```
npm install websocket
npm install cheerio
```

after running these both commands, now clone the repo using
git:
```
git clone https://github.com/NOXY-JS/ICEbot.git
```
After doing this, go to your browser and install the .zip file extension from "ICEbot () node.zip" file
then load "Gartic.io" to see if it works.
The using mode is the same as ICEbot v6 but its more faster than using it on normal browsers.

Some resources may not work but it will be fixed soon and added to this repo.
